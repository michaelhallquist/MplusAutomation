Author: Michael Hallquist, Joshua Wiley
Maintainer: Michael Hallquist <michael.hallquist@gmail.com>
Description: The MplusAutomation package leverages the flexibility of the R
    language to automate latent variable model estimation and interpretation
    using Mplus, a powerful latent variable modeling program developed by
    Muthen and Muthen (www.statmodel.com). Specifically, MplusAutomation
    provides routines for creating related groups of models, running batches of
    models, and extracting and tabulating model parameters and fit statistics.
