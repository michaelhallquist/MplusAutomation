 - notice:      The default of SummaryTable() is now "none", to prevent accidental printing to console. Thanks to cjvanlissa for the pull request.

 - feature:     Unit testing has been added to check that a variety of Mplus User Guide examples are read in correctly.
 - feature:     readModels() now returns the entire raw output file. This means that R objects from Mplus can be saved and contain all needed output. Mplus text input/output files do not need to be kept for a complete record. The raw output file is stored in the $output list element.
 - feature:     MplusAutomation now tries harder to find an Mplus (or Mplus Demo as a fallback) command in an OS independent way thanks to new function detectMplus(). This takes over the default Mplus_command argument in runModels() and mplusModeler(), which should mean it works more often, on more platforms, without users needing to specify the command/path to Mplus.
