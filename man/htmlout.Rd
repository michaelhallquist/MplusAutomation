\description{
This is an internal utility function to help with testing MplusAutomation.
On the Mplus website, many output files are included, which are good tests.
However, they are stored in HTML files. This function reads them in,
strips the HTML parts leaving just the output file, and then writes it to
disk and returns the file name, which can be used with \code{readModels()}
for testing.
