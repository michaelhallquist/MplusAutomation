\usage{
cd(base, pre, num)
}
\arguments{
\item{base}{a character string with the base path to the directory. This is required.}

\item{pre}{an optional character string with the prefix to add to
the base path. Non character strings will be coerced to character class.}

\item{num}{an optional character string, prefixed by \code{pre}.
Non character strings will be coerced to character class.}
}
\value{
NULL, changes the current working directory
}
\description{
The function takes a path and changes the current working directory
to the path. If the directory specified in the path does not
currently exist, it will be created.
}
\details{
The function has been designed to be platform independent,
although it has had limited testing. Path creation is done using
\code{file.path}, the existence of the directory is checked using
\code{file.exists} and the directory created with \code{dir.create}.
Only the first argument, is required.  The other optional arguments
are handy when one wants to create many similar directories with a common base.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# an example just using the base
cd("~/testdir")

# an example using the optional arguments
base <- "~/testdir"
pre <- "test_"

cd(base, pre, 1)
cd(base, pre, 2)
}
