This function is designed to remove warnings in Mplus output files
about variable names being greater than 8 characters. It replaces them
with a note that the warnings were removed and a count of how many warnings
were removed.
}
\details{
This is an internal function and not meant to be directly called by the
user under most circumstances. It is called by \code{\link{mplusModeler}}
when the \code{varwarnings = FALSE} argument is used.
