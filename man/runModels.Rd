\usage{
  runModels(directory = getwd(), recursive = FALSE,
    showOutput = FALSE, replaceOutfile = "always",
    logFile = "Mplus Run Models.log",
    Mplus_command = "Mplus")
}
\arguments{
  \item{directory}{the directory containing Mplus input
  files (.inp) to run.  Defaults to the current working
  directory. Example: \dQuote{C:/Users/Michael/Mplus Runs}}

  \item{recursive}{optional. If \code{TRUE}, run all models
  nested in subdirectories within \code{directory}.
  Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

  \item{filefilter}{a Perl regular expression
  (PCRE-compatible) specifying particular input files to
  be run within \code{directory}. See \code{regex} or
  \url{http://www.pcre.org/pcre.txt} for details about
  regular expression syntax.}

  \item{showOutput}{optional. If \code{TRUE}, show
  estimation output (TECH8) in the R console. Note that if
  run within Rgui, output will display within R, but if run
  via Rterm, a separate window will appear during
  estimation.}

  \item{replaceOutfile}{optional. Currently supports three
  settings: \dQuote{always}, which runs all models,
  regardless of whether an output file for the model
  exists; \dQuote{never}, which does not run any model that
  has an existing output file; and \dQuote{modifiedDate},
  which only runs a model if the modified date for the
  input file is more recent than the output file modified
  date (implying there have been updates to the model).}

  \item{logFile}{optional. If non-null, specifies a file
  (and optionally, directory) that records the settings
  passed into the function and the models run (or skipped)
  during the run.}

  \item{Mplus_command}{optional. N.B.: No need to pass this
  parameter for most users (has intelligent defaults).
  Allows the user to specify the name/path of the Mplus
  executable to be used for running models. This covers
  situations where Mplus is not in the system's path, or
  where one wants to test different versions of the Mplus
  program.}
}
\value{
  None. Function is used for its side effects (running
  models).
}
\description{
  This function runs a group of Mplus models (.inp files)
  located within a single directory or nested within
  subdirectories.
