\title{Create an HTML file containing a summary table of Mplus model statistics}
\usage{
HTMLSummaryTable(
  modelList,
  filename = file.path(getwd(), "Model Comparison.html"),
  keepCols,
  dropCols,
  sortBy = NULL,
  display = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelList}{A list of models (as a \code{data.frame}) returned from the \code{extractModelSummaries} function.}

\item{filename}{The name of the HTML file to be created. Can be an absolute or relative path. If \code{filename}
is a relative path or just the filename, then it is assumed that the file resides in the working
directory \code{getwd()}. Example: \code{"Mplus Summary.html"}}

\item{keepCols}{A vector of character strings indicating which columns/variables to display in the summary.
Only columns included in this list will be displayed (all others excluded). By default, \code{keepCols}
is: \code{c("Title", "LL", "Parameters", "AIC", "AICC", "BIC", "RMSEA_Estimate")}. Example: \code{c("Title", "LL", "AIC", "CFI")}}

\item{dropCols}{A vector of character strings indicating which columns/variables to omit from the summary.
Any column not included in this list will be displayed. By default, \code{dropCols} is \code{NULL}.
Example: \code{c("InputInstructions", "TLI")}}

\item{sortBy}{optional. Field name (as character string) by which to sort the table. Typically an information criterion
(e.g., "AIC" or "BIC") is used to sort the table.
Defaults to \code{NULL}, which does not sort the table.}

\item{display}{optional. This parameter specifies whether to display the table in a web
browser upon creation (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}).}
}
\value{
No value is returned by this function. It is solely used to create an HTML file containing summary statistics.
}
\description{
Creates an HTML file containing a summary table of model fit statistics extracted using the \code{extractModelSummaries} function.
By default, the following summary statistics are included: \code{Title, LL, Parameters, AIC, AICC, BIC, RMSEA_Estimate},
but these are customizable using the \code{keepCols} and \code{dropCols} parameters.
}
\note{
You must choose between \code{keepCols} and \code{dropCols} because it is not sensible to use these
together to include and exclude columns. The function will error if you include both parameters.
