\title{Automating Mplus Model Estimation and Interpretation}
\description{
The MplusAutomation package leverages the flexibility of the
R language to automate latent variable model estimation and interpretation
using 'Mplus', a powerful latent variable modeling program developed by Muthen
and Muthen (\url{http://www.statmodel.com}). Specifically, MplusAutomation provides routines
for creating related groups of models, running batches of models, and extracting
and tabulating model parameters and fit statistics.
}
\details{
The MplusAutomation package has four primary purposes:
\itemize{
\item To automatically run groups/batches of models.
\item To provide routines to extract model fit statistics, parameter estimates, and raw data from 'Mplus' output files.
\item To facilitate comparisons among models
\item To provide a template language that allows for the creation of related input files.
The core routine for running batches of models is \code{\link{runModels}}, with
an easy-to-use GUI wrapper, \code{\link{runModels_Interactive}}.
}

The core routine for extracting information from 'Mplus' outputs is \code{\link{readModels}}, which
returns a list containing all output sections that the package can extract.

To extract summaries, parameters, modification indices, SAVEDATA output, and all other sections that the package
can understand, use the \code{\link{readModels}} function. This is the recommended way to extract 'Mplus'
output with this package. If the \code{target} argument to \code{\link{readModels}} is a single .out file,
an \code{mplus.model} (that is also a \code{list}) will be returned containing all output sections that
the package can extract. If \code{target} is a directory, a list of \code{mplus.model} objects will be returned,
named according to the output filenames.

Note: \code{\link{extractModelSummaries}} is deprecated and \code{\link{readModels}} should be preferred.
To extract model summary statistics from one or more output files, see
\code{\link{extractModelSummaries}}, which returns a \code{data.frame} of
fit statistics for models located within a directory. Model fit results can
be summarized in tabular form (for comparing among models) using
\code{\link{showSummaryTable}} (displays table in separate window),
\code{\link{HTMLSummaryTable}} (creates HTML file containing summary table),
or \code{\link{LatexSummaryTable}} (returns a LaTex-formatted table of
summary statistics).

Detailed model fit and parameter comparisons between two models can be obtained using
\code{\link{compareModels}}.

To create a group of related models from a single template, see \code{\link{createModels}}.
Please read the MplusAutomation vignette provided along with the package (and on the CRAN website)
in order to understand the template language: vignette("Vignette", package="MplusAutomation").

In addition to the major functions above, a function for converting an R data.frame
for use with 'Mplus' is provided: \code{\link{prepareMplusData}}. This converts the
data.frame to a tab-delimited file and provides an 'Mplus' syntax stub for variable names.
